# GeoFlare


GeoFlare is a real-time platform that leveraged geospatial computer vision and artificial intelligence to rapidly process environmental data and provide immediate, strategic actions to best tackle it.

We were inspired by strides made in military defense startups like Palantir and Anduril to develop a comprehensive, action-based platform to allow firefighters to focus on saving lives, not planning strategy.

## Tech Stack

 The front end was created using React, SASS (for the landing page), Tailwind.css, Typescript, and Next.js. The backend was developed using Node.js, FireBase, Python, and FastAPI with Gemini/PyTorch integrations for the ML model and the chatbot interface.
