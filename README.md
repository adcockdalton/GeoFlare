# GeoFlare


GeoFlare is a real-time platform that leveraged geospatial computer vision and artificial intelligence to rapidly process environmental data and provide immediate, strategic actions to best tackle it.

We were inspired by strides made in military defense startups like Palantir and Anduril to develop a comprehensive, action-based platform to allow firefighters to focus on saving lives, not planning strategy.

## Tech Stack

For the front-end, we used TypeScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, and Figma.
For the backend, we used Node.js, FireBase, Python, and FastAPI.
